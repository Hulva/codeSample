## Spring Tutorials

This project is **a collection of small and focused tutorials** each covering a single and well defined area of development. Most of the tutorial projects are focused on the `Spring Framework` (and `Spring Security`). In additional to Spring, the following technologies are in focus: `core Java`, `Jackson`, `HttpClient`, `Guava`.

## Working with the code in Eclipse

Any IDE can be used to work with the projects, but if you're using Eclipse, consider the following.
